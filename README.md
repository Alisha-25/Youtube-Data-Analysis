# Youtube-Data-Analysis
This project involves comprehensive analysis of YouTube data using PySpark, focusing on title analysis and various NLP tasks. After data cleaning, including removing unnecessary columns and handling null values, the project explores yearly statistics, identifies the top 10 most viewed videos, and balances the dataset using oversampling. Advanced NLP techniques such as tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and sentiment analysis are applied to the video titles. Additionally, correlation analysis is conducted to uncover relationships between various features, and the results are visualized to provide insights into video performance.
